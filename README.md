# writingSamples
Here you can find some writing samples that highlight my policy interests, analysis skills, and writing abilities. 
* I am particularly interested in public interest technology and how public sector entities can leverage data for the public benefit.

### publicTransit_PolicyBrief
* In this one page policy brief I recommend how the Pittsburgh public transit authority should remedy a decrease in ridership while maintaining the service needed for the communities of Pittsburgh. This policy brief was an assignment from my Public Policy writing course.

### bridgeInspectionTechnology_PolicyMemo
* In this policy memo I recommend how the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation can adopt drone technology to improve the efficiency of their bridge inspections and address the backlog of bridge inspections that have resulted in many bridges across the state being in a poor condition. This policy memo was my final project from my Public Policy writing course.

### digitalHealth_PolicyPresentation
* In this presentation I recommend the city of Pittsburgh to adopt a digital health program to address the needs of the impacted population of residents with breathing complications as a result of high levels of pollution in the area. This policy presentation was my final project from my strategic presentations course.
